# Getting Started with Zilliqa Fullstack App

The Zilliqa Fullstack app is a full-fledged application on the Zilliqa Blockchain for listing and renting houses.

[Watch the demo](https://www.loom.com/share/7f9530f80de34ba6be8b9a954f331e47).

[Try the app](https://rentonzilliqa-frontend.vercel.app).

## The technology

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the frontend.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling.
- The `/src/scilla` contains the Scilla contract. We can use the [Zilliqa JavaScript Library](https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa-JavaScript-Library) or the Scilla Online IDE to deploy the contract. Please add the contract address in `REACT_APP_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable in a `.env` file in the root of the project.
